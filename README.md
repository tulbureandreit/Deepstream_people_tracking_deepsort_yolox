# Deepstream_people_tracking_deepsort_yolox
People tracking and general COCO objects if you wish. Just modify the object detection n_classes detected.

Ran on Nvidia Jetson Xavier AGX with Deepstream 6.0.

I would suggest checking jetson_release details, to see if these 2 are compatible (TRT 8, Jetpack 4.6, Cuda 10.2 etc)
